# Tic-Tac-Toe game

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It achieves the following:
- Lets you play tic-tac-toe
- Indicates when a player has won the game,
- Stores a game’s history as a game progresses
- Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.
